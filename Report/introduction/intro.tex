This report explores the concept of blockchain technology, specifically focusing on the hybrid consensus mechanism utilized by Ethereum as it transitions from Proof of Work (PoW) to Proof of Stake (PoS). The primary goal of this project is to understand the vulnerabilities associated with this hybrid system, which combines elements of both PoW and PoS mechanisms. As blockchain technology continues to evolve, understanding these vulnerabilities is crucial for improving the security and efficiency of future implementations.

To provide a practical perspective on the theoretical vulnerabilities discussed, this report is accompanied by Python-based implementations that simulate potential security breaches within a simplified model of a hybrid blockchain system. These demonstrations are intended to offer insights into how such vulnerabilities can be exploited and, consequently, how they might be mitigated.
